# Reymond Joaquin: Web Penetration Tester Portfolio & Projects
Hi, I‚Äôm Reymond Joaquin üëã. I‚Äôm an aspiring **Web Penetration Tester** and a **BSIS student** with a strong passion for building custom tools and expanding my knowledge in **ethical hacking**, **computer networking**, **Linux**, and **programming**.

## Skills üí°
- **Programming Languages:** üßë‚Äçüíª  Python (Intermediate), C++ (Basic), Bash Scripting (Basic)
- **Ethical Hacking Tools:** üîß Familiar with Nmap, Metasploit, Hydra, Dirbuster, Gobuster, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Netcat
- **Computer Networking:** üåê Subnetting, Protocols, Networking Device, Topologies, TCP/IP and OSI Models
- **OS:** üñ•Ô∏è Kali Linux (Basic), Windows(Basic)

## Key Projects üîë
### 1. AutoWebRecon v0.1 Pre-release üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
An automation tool for web reconnaissance that integrates multiple existing tools and commands, designed to simplify and speed up the process of gathering information about web targets.

### 2. IPNetSolver v1.2 üî¢ 
IPNetSolver is a powerful tool designed to assist with solving complex networking problems, including subnetting, IP conversions, and supernetting. It supports various networking tasks, such as:

- **FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Masking)**: Allows users to divide a network into subnets with an equal number of hosts, ensuring optimal utilization of available IP addresses.
- **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**: Provides flexibility by allowing subnets of different sizes, which is ideal for organizations with varying network requirements.
- **Supernetting**: Enables the process of combining multiple smaller networks into a larger one, helping optimize address space and routing efficiency.
- **Binary Conversion**: Offers a quick conversion tool for changing decimal numbers to binary and vice versa, crucial for subnetting and network address calculations.
- **Subnetting a Subnet**: Supports the task of subnetting within an existing subnet, providing granular control over IP allocation for complex network architectures.

IPNetSolver handles prefix lengths from **/1** to **/32**, with special consideration that **/32** cannot be subnetted. The tool is designed to handle a wide array of IP and networking problems, offering both beginner-friendly and advanced modes of operation, ensuring accessibility for all skill levels.

### 3. OpenPortHunter v1.2üëÄ
OpenPortHunter is a port scanning tool designed to identify open ports on target systems and assess potential security vulnerabilities. It features several customizable scanning options, including:

- **Specific Ports**: Allows scanning of user-defined port ranges for tailored assessments.
- **Well-Known Ports (1-1023)**: Scans the most common ports typically associated with essential services like HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), etc.
- **Registered Ports (1024-49151)**: Scans ports used by a range of applications and services.
- **Ephemeral Ports (49152-65535)**: Focuses on the ports typically used for dynamic connections.
- **Scan All Ports (1-65535)**: Scans the entire range of ports to ensure no potential entry points are missed.

In addition to open port discovery, **OpenPortHunter** also gathers **WHOIS information** for the target domain, providing insight into the domain's registration details, including ownership and contact information. While designed for broad assessments, the tool can experience slower scanning times on larger networks or more complex systems due to the extensive nature of the scan.

### 4. WebDirsCovery v1.0 üìÇüëÅÔ∏è
WebDirsCovery is a tool designed to automate and simplify the process of discovering hidden directories on web servers. It features several scanning modes to suit different use cases and skill levels:

- **Automated Directory Scan**: Automatically scans a predefined list of common directories (e.g., /admin, /login, /uploads) on a target website to discover hidden or unsecured pages quickly.
- **Custom Directory Scan**: Allows users to specify their own list of directories (in the form of a file), enabling customized scans for specific paths that may not be part of standard directories.
- **Manual Directory Scan**: Provides full control by allowing users to manually input specific directories one at a time, ideal for testing specific paths that might not be included in typical wordlists.

Designed to speed up the process of web reconnaissance, **WebDirsCovery** utilizes a combination of common, custom, and user-specified directory lists to maximize discovery potential. It‚Äôs an efficient tool for both beginners who want automated scans and advanced users who need customization and manual control over directory testing.
